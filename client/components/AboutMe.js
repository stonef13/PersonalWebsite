          <p>
            Before entering the world of tech, I was involved in the performing
            arts. I had dabbled in coding since high school, but when I actually
            dove into it, I absolutely fell in love. I started with self
            teaching, and then became more and more involved until I found
            myself deep in an immersive coding bootcamp with Fullstack Academy.
            There I was certified in a tech stack revolving around Node.js,
            React, PostgreSQL, and Express.js. With a huge desire to learn, I
            immediately became fascinated by the power of technology (Especially
            JavaScript). This is something that is changing every day and always
            leads to an opportunity to learn and grow. I plan to combine my
            creative background with my coding skills to effectively create,
            problem solve, and communicate to lead to an output of success.

            When Iâ€™m not coding or learning new technology, you can find me
            playing the guitar, writing music, hiking, or finding places to
            explore in my new home of Los Angeles.
