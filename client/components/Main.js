        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Before entering the world of tech, I was involved in the performing
          arts. I had dabbled in coding since high school, but when I actually
          dove into it, I absolutely fell in love. I started with self teaching,
          and then became more and more involved until I found myself deep in an
          immersive coding bootcamp with Fullstack Academy. There I was
          certified in a tech stack revolving around Node.js, React, PostgreSQL,
          and Express.js. With a huge desire to learn, I immediately became
          fascinated by the power of technology (Especially JavaScript). This is
          something that is changing every day and always leads to an
          opportunity to learn and grow. I plan to combine my creative
          background with my coding skills to effectively create, problem solve,
          and communicate to lead to an output of success.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Iâ€™m not coding or learning new technology, you can find me
          playing the guitar, writing music, hiking, or finding places to
          explore in my new home of Los Angeles.
